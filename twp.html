            <h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
            <p>I decided to record my trash this week because I want to know what I use and don’t use in my daily life. By recording whatever I throw out, I gain an understanding of what I use on a more consistent basis, to the point where I may need to throw out something due to complete use of it. On the contrary, sometimes I throw things out because I did not use enough before it expires. This again indicates its use to me, but rather than using it to its fullest, it displays that I did not use said product (now trash) enough. 
                <br>
                <br> 
                By doing this weekly, I can track what I use more and what I use less, which may aid my decision-making when buying a product. This project did start out of fun and boredom, but has come to serve a useful purpose in my life. I would suggest everyone to start doing this, even if it takes an unnecessary amount of time. Sometimes, even if it is lengthy to finish my documentation of my trash of the week, I continue with it just to see the results of what I do and don’t throw out. With the judgement from this project, I am not only able to take some extra time I have and do something entertaining, but I am also saving myself money directly by making more wise and informed financial decisions.

            <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
            <p> This week, I did not encounter too many surprises. Some notable things I did notice are that a lot of items (even non-recorded ones) were being thrown out due to expiration. I should look into being less wasteful by buying less in the future.
                <br>
                <br>First, I would group my trash into 3 categories this week. One such category will be wellness items, which would contain <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tums">medicine</a>, a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_rapid_antigen_test">COVID test</a>, and a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball_(ball)">volleyball</a>. These objects are being thrown out because they have either served their purpose (COVID test), they have expired (medicine), or they are simply broken (volleyball which has a tear on the side).
                <br>
                <br>Another category will be for hygiene, containing an old <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towel">towel</a>, an empty <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_dispenser">soap bottle</a>, and a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_bag">plastic bag</a> which used to contain travel toiletries. These objects are being thrown out due to the towel no longer drying as well (and having a rough surface which irritates my skin), the product itself is broken (the plastic bag having a hole in it), and the product serving its purpose (the soap bottle has no more soap).
                <br>
                <br>Finally, the last category will be for things that aren’t necessarily in either of these two categories, but are still trash (an empty <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballpoint_pen">pen</a>, an empty bag of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato_chip">chips</a>, a set of instructions for <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard">PC building</a>). All of these items have been used to their fullest and no longer have a use to me. Therefore, I am throwing them out.

            <p>
                The item of the week is the volleyball. I chose this as my item of the week because of the sentimental value it holds to me. This was the first volleyball I bought while I was still in high school, when I was just getting into volleyball. I used to play with it in my backyard for hours every day while stuck at home due to the COVID outbreak. Regardless of the weather conditions, I would continue playing with it to eventually improve my skills. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Volleyballs are made of 3 layers. The first layer of a volleyball is made of a material called polyisobutylene, which allows the ball to stay light. The second layer of the ball is made of a cloth-like material, similar to gauze, for the purpose of the first layer to stick. Finally, the third and innermost layer of the ball is made of leather (or any sort of synthetic substitute). This third layer is separated into panels, with older ones having 18-20 panels, but since 2008, 8 panels have been the standard. <a href = "https://branded.disruptsports.com/blogs/blog/how-its-madepromotional-volleyballs ">Source</a>

                Overall, my experience with my notable trash went well. It was a good reflection of how I used the items I purchased, and if they were worth it to me or not. Looking ahead, I plan on buying less medicine (since I don’t get sick too often). For those of you still reading, thank you for taking the time out of your day to read all of this. Though it isn’t the most organized set of thoughts, it accurately describes how I feel about all these items. If you have anything interesting to comment about, whether it be about my items, or even your own, feel free to comment it down below. Thank you so much again for your time!
