    <h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
    <p>
      I decided to record my trash this week because I want to know what I use
      and don’t use in my daily life. By recording whatever I throw out, I gain
      an understanding of what I use on a more consistent basis, to the point
      where I may need to throw out something due to complete use of it. On the
      contrary, sometimes I throw things out because I did not use enough
      before it expires. This again indicates its use to me, but rather than
      using it to its fullest, it displays that I did not use said product (now
      trash) enough.
      <br /><br />
      By doing this weekly, I can track what I use more and what I use less,
      which may aid my decision-making when buying a product. This project did
      start out of fun and boredom, but has come to serve a useful purpose in
      my life. I would suggest everyone to start doing this, even if it takes
      an unnecessary amount of time. Sometimes, even if it is lengthy to finish
      my documentation of my trash of the week, I continue with it just to see
      the results of what I do and don’t throw out. With the judgement from
      this project, I am not only able to take some extra time I have and do
      something entertaining, but I am also saving myself money directly by
      making more wise and informed financial decisions. Read more by clicking the expanded preface link above!

    <!-- Overview Section -->
    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This week, I did not encounter too many surprises. Some notable things I
      did notice are that a lot of items (even non-recorded ones) were being
      thrown out due to expiration. I should look into being less wasteful by
      buying less in the future.
      <br /><br />
      First, I would group my trash into 3 categories this week. One such
      category will be wellness items, which would contain
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tums">medicine</a>,
      a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_rapid_antigen_test"
        >COVID test</a
      >, and a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball_(ball)">volleyball</a>.
      These objects are being thrown out because they have either served their
      purpose (COVID test), they have expired (medicine), or they are simply
      broken (volleyball which has a tear on the side).
      <br /><br />
      Another category will be for hygiene, containing an old
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towel">towel</a>, an empty
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_dispenser">soap bottle</a>,
      and a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_bag">plastic bag</a> which
      used to contain travel toiletries. These objects are being thrown out due
      to the towel no longer drying as well (and having a rough surface which
      irritates my skin), the product itself is broken (the plastic bag having
      a hole in it), and the product serving its purpose (the soap bottle has
      no more soap).
      <br /><br />
      Finally, the last category will be for things that aren’t necessarily in
      either of these two categories, but are still trash (an empty
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballpoint_pen">pen</a>, an empty
      bag of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato_chip">chips</a>, a set of
      instructions for
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard"
        >PC building</a
      >). All of these items have been used to their fullest and no longer have
      a use to me. Therefore, I am throwing them out.

    <!-- Profile (Item of the Week) -->
    <h2 id="profile">Item Of The Week</h2>
    <p>
      The item of the week is the volleyball. I chose this as my item of
      the week because of the sentimental value it holds to me. This was
      the first volleyball I bought while I was still in high school,
      when I was just getting into volleyball. I used to play with it in
      my backyard for hours every day while stuck at home due to the
      COVID outbreak. Regardless of the weather conditions, I would
      continue playing with it to eventually improve my skills.
      <br /><br />
      Volleyballs are made of 3 layers. The first layer of a volleyball
      is made of a material called polyisobutylene, which allows the ball
      to stay light. The second layer of the ball is made of a
      cloth-like material, similar to gauze, for the purpose of the first
      layer to stick. Finally, the third and innermost layer of the ball
      is made of leather (or any sort of synthetic substitute). This
      third layer is separated into panels, with older ones having 18-20
      panels, but since 2008, 8 panels have been the standard.

      Overall, my experience with my notable trash went well. It was a
      good reflection of how I used the items I purchased, and if they
      were worth it to me or not. Looking ahead, I plan on buying less
      medicine (since I don’t get sick too often). For those of you still
      reading, thank you for taking the time out of your day to read all
      of this. Though it isn’t the most organized set of thoughts, it
      accurately describes how I feel about all these items. If you have
      anything interesting to comment about, whether it be about my
      items, or even your own, feel free to comment it down below. Thank
      you so much again for your time!
