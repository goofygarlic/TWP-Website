      Hi! I'm Karthik, and I'm currently a student studying computer science and math. While in school, I work on side projects attempting to solve various real-world problems, which is a goal of mine in the future. One that I am working on now includes mapping traffic data after the implementation of congestion pricing in New York City. Some things I like to do in my free time are playing video games like Minecraft, League of Legends, and the Persona series, reading, and playing volleyball. Some fun facts about me! My MBTI is INFP; I enjoy collecting funko pops (specifically the Eeveelutions), and I love to travel. The last place I went to was New Zealand and it was one of the most beautiful countries I've ever visited.
