    <h1>Expanded Preface</h1>

    <p>
      In this expanded preface, I delve deeper into the motivations and
      experiences behind the TWP project. The idea initially came from
      a passing conversation about how our possessions shape our identity
      and how discarding items can often go unnoticed. I wanted to shine
      a light on the everyday objects we interact with. (TEMPLATE)

    <p>
      Through recording my trash, I became more aware of trends in my buying
      habits: <strong>impulse purchases</strong>, recurring staples, 
      and the guilt of throwing out items before fully using them. 
      This small act of documentation helped me see the 
      <a href="https://www.epa.gov/recycle" target="_blank" class="inline-ref">
        broader implications</a> of consumer culture and waste 
      management. Over time, I refined my approach to incorporate 
      minimalism and learned how to distinguish between fleeting wants 
      and genuine needs. (TEMPLATE)

      The <em>Trash of the Week</em> series also led me to question the 
      <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-consumption-production" 
         target="_blank"
         class="inline-ref">
        sustainability</a> aspects behind each product I bought. 
      Packaging materials, shipping distances, and manufacturing processes 
      all factored into the real cost of any item I ultimately threw away.
      This reflection has encouraged me to buy second-hand or eco-friendly 
      alternatives when possible and to share these considerations with 
      family and friends. (TEMPLATE)
    </p>

    <p>
      Ultimately, this project is part introspective journal, part 
      environmental activism. By paying attention to the items that come 
      and go in my life, I'm taking small but tangible steps toward reducing 
      waste and building awareness. I hope that by sharing this journey, 
      others might take an interest in their own daily discards and, in turn, 
      become more conscious consumers. (TEMPLATE)
